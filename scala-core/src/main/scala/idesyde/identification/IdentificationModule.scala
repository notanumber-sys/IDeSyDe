/** The trait/interface for an identification module defines the identification and integration rules
  * required to power the design space identification process [1].
  * 
  * [[identificationRules]] are functions that abstracts [[DesignModel]]s systematically to [[DecisionModel]]s 
  * until it becomes a set of "solvable" parameters and functions.
  * 
  * [[integrationRules]] are basically the inverse of [[identificationRules]]: They take solved [[DecisionModels]]
  * and "integrate" the solutions in the abstracted domain back to the design domain, in the [[DesignModel]]s.
