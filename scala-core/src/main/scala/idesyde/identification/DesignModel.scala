/** The trait/interface for a design model in the design space identification methodology, as
  * defined in [1].
  *
  * In essence, the [[DesignModel]] is the system model, or pragmatically, a wrapper around the
  * original system model data types. It can be thought of conceptually as the "database" with all
  * the information about the system we need. The only requirement that is imposed on concrete
  * [[DesignModel]] s is that they have a notion of "identifiers" so that two elements of type
  * [[ElementT]] can always be compared for equality and uniqueness. The ID of an element does not
  * have to be anything pretty, it could very well be integers, as long as they are _unique_ for
  * _unique_ elements.
